Code Name: Taha is a short, old-school 2D action RPG.     

You will control me and an aspiring adventurer who comes to an Gotham City's island to save all super hereos and so on.

What You Can Do in This Game: 

 - Fight monsters.

- Get EXP and level up your character. 

 - Explore the island  and  dungeon. 

 - Gather items, and buy/sell them with a NPC.

-Conversation with NPC and so on... - DO NOT FORGET- 

 - Parry the attack and give massive damage! 

 - Fight a boss! 

The game is solely developed in Java programming language. Everything is written from scratch including the game engine, using the default Java class library. 

This is more like a tech demo rather than a full-fledged game and you can beat it in about 15-30 minutes. But I hope you will enjoy his little kitty adventure!
