Code Name: Innie is a short, old-school 2D action RPG.     

You are a small Cat that called Innie(the best cat ever ever), an aspiring adventurer who comes to an Gotham City's island to save all super hereos and so on.

What You Can Do in This Game: 

 - Fight monsters.

The game is solely developed in Java programming language. Everything is written from scratch including the game engine, using the default Java class library.
